# üöÄ Getting started with Strapi

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local development (Strapi)

This steps run Strapi in development mode locally, without importing any mock data. This is used for a fresh copy of Strapi and its configuration. 

1. Run `yarn` to install modules and Strapi CLI
2. Run `yarn build`
3. Run `yarn develop`
4. Create admin user

## üê≥ Local development with mock data (Docker)

In order to access a quick API mock, you need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed locally.

1. Copy `env.dev` to `.env`
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Create admin user (unskippable)
4. Access the API `http://localhost:1337/api/pages?populate=*`

More API references in the Postman collection.
